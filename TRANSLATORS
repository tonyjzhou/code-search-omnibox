How can Chrome extension, theme, webapp to appear in all the languages of the world

The reference for that magic is here  http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/i18n.html


WHAT DO THAT MEAN FOR YOU AS A TRANSLATOR ?

Say you want to translate the extension to the esperanto language

1. You should know what its code language is : {eo} 
If you don't, look here https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/i18n?hl=fr&csw=1#localeTable
Actually esperanto is not allowed yet, but never mind, the principle is the same

2. Duplicate _locales/eo/messages.json into _locales/eo/messages.json

3. Edit _locales/eo/messages.json
Each time you see something like this:
  "search_string": {
    "message": "hello world",
    "description": "The string we search for. Put %20 between words that go together."
  }

Translate like this
  "search_string": {
    "message": "saluton mundo",
    "description": "The string we search for. Put %20 between words that go together."
  }

Have fun :-)

4. Don't forget to send this file translated in esperanto of course
